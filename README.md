# Commit-message-generator
A Chrome extension that uses an API called 'whatthecommit' to generate and display a random and humorous git commit message.

Not yet available on the chrome extension store but you can try it out by downloading the source code.

## How to Install
- Download the **.zip** file
- Extract the **.zip** file
- Go to Chrome
- Click the three dots on the top-right

Now, you can use it as you would use any other extension.
